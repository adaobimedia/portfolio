<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>I work full time as a Product Manager in the civil service. I'm currently leading a Discovery into how we can use the (remote) lessons learnt during the Covid-19 pandemic to improve the blended learning experience for Further Education students and teachers. My particular focus is on digital curriculum resources used in lessons. To help me become a more rounded PM, I'm learning to code in my spare time. The idea is that I'll learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
<p>I haven't always worked in tech, though. I'm actually a trained broadcast journalist, and worked in the commercial sector, the Guardian and the BBC too. Being a Product Manager lets me bring my creative side together with my interest in user-centred products. Being able to code will give me the ability to work on side projects and ideas that have been on my mind for some time. It feels a bit like all of my work experience and my recent MBA have come together to give me the building blocks I'll need for the next step in my journey... More on this to follow.</p>
